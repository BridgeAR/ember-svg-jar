## Installation

`$ ember install ember-svg-jar`

## How to try it in 3 minutes?

- Install the addon and put some SVG files to any place in your `public` directory.

- Run the development server: `$ ember serve`

- Open this link with Chrome: `http://localhost:4200/ember-svg-jar/index.html`

- You should see your SVG assets there, select one and click `Enter` (it will copy it to the clipboard).

- Paste it into any `hbs` template in your app.

- Open a page with your browser that will render the modified template. You should see your SVG there.

That's about it! Docs and tests are comming very soon.
